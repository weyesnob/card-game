Call all handlers from game loop (attacks, summons, etc)? What about dying cards? Seems clunky if the game loop has to check if a monster
    lost all HP after an attack. Outline which handlers are called internally and which are called from game loop

Use state machine to implement turn phases

Top card of deck is self.deck[-1]

Use Player class to interface with Card objects
    -> need some sort of indicator per card which event handlers are available
    -> effects which will always trigger vs effects which have to be activated by the player

"on_"-event handlers only for side effects?
or methods like "take_damage" for standard game logic?
goal: event handlers should not interact with the events that called them -> somewhat of a hierarchical structure

Checks in same methods that implement game logic? Nott

Should I pass the name to super()? It is not important to game logic
